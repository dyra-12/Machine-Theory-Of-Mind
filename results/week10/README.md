# Week 10 Human Pilot Outputs

This folder keeps the artifacts we reference externally:

- `pilot_ratings_combined.csv` &mdash; cleaned snapshot of all collected pilot ratings.
- `agent_means.csv` &mdash; aggregated warmth/competence/trust means by agent type.
- `agent_comparison.png` &mdash; the figure published in the Week 10 summary.

Upstream collection still happens in `data/human_pilot/pilot_ratings.csv`; see `docs/week10_summary.md` for interpretation details.

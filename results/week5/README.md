# Week 5 Negotiation Outputs

Retained artifacts for external sharing:

- `analysis_summary.json` &mdash; aggregate stats across all Week 5 sweeps.
- `bayesian_combo_summary.csv` &mdash; merged table of agent settings and outcomes.
- `stats_summary.json` &mdash; detailed SIQ and reward summary values.
- `plots/` &mdash; publication-ready figures.

Deep-dive docs (final_combined_report, one_page_spec, summary_2page, weekly_report) were relocated to `docs/internal/results/week5/`.

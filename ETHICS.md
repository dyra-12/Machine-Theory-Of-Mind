# Research Ethics & Responsible Use

## Ethical Scope

This repository presents a methodological, proof-of-concept research framework in machine learning and human–AI interaction. The work focuses on algorithmic design, interpretability, and evaluation of artificial agents and does not constitute a clinical, psychological, or diagnostic system.

All experiments are designed to comply with minimal-risk research standards commonly applied in computational social science, HCI, and AI research.

## Human-in-the-Loop Pilot Study

A limited human-in-the-loop pilot study was conducted solely to evaluate perceived social attributes of artificial agents (warmth, competence, trust).

The study involved:
- Adult participants (18+)
- Short, non-deceptive interaction snippets
- Voluntary participation with digital informed consent
- No collection of personally identifying information (PII)
- No collection of free-text responses or demographic attributes

Participants evaluated agent behavior only; no assessment of participants themselves was performed.

## Data Protection and Privacy

The study follows principles of data minimization and privacy-by-design:

- Only structured 7-point Likert-scale ratings were collected
- Responses were anonymized at collection time
- Sessions were identified solely by randomly generated completion codes
- Timestamps were recorded in UTC without linkage to identity or location

No names, contact details, IP addresses, or sensitive personal attributes were stored or processed.

## Risk Assessment

This study is classified as minimal risk, as it:
- Involves no deception, manipulation, or stress induction
- Poses no foreseeable psychological, social, or economic harm
- Collects no sensitive or identifying personal data
- Evaluates perceptions of artificial agents rather than human subjects

Accordingly, the study aligns with categories typically considered ethics-exempt or waiver-eligible under institutional research guidelines for non-clinical, anonymized HCI research.

## Data Use and Availability

Collected data are used exclusively for:
- Aggregate statistical analysis
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Reproducibility of reported results

Only aggregated or derived data artifacts are published in this repository. Raw pilot data are treated as internal research records and should not be redistributed without appropriate review.

## Non-Clinical Disclaimer

This project:
- Does not model full human psychology
- Does not make clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic claims
- Is not intended for deployment in real-world decision-making involving individuals

Any discussion of computational psychiatry is theoretical and methodological, intended to motivate future research directions rather than applied clinical use.

## Ethical Commitment

This repository is guided by principles of transparency, interpretability, respect for human participants, responsible experimentation, and reproducible research practices.

Future extensions involving richer human data, longitudinal studies, or real-world deployment will be conducted only under appropriate institutional ethics approval.

# Ethics & Data Governance

This project conducts small-scale, non-clinical pilot studies to evaluate
perceptions of AI agents (warmth, competence, trust). The project adheres to
the following principles for ethics, participant protection, and data
governance.

1. Non-clinical pilot. The human pilot described in this repository is an
   exploratory, non-clinical study. It does not involve medical or clinical
   interventions, diagnosis, or treatment. The stimuli are short negotiation
   dialogues produced by agents and do not solicit sensitive personal health
   information.

2. Informed and voluntary consent. Participants were informed of the study's
   purpose and the voluntary nature of participation via the web interface.
   Participation was free to decline at any time, and participants could
   withdraw before submitting ratings.

3. Anonymization and minimal data collection. Collected pilot data are
   anonymized. We do not collect names, e-mail addresses, IP addresses, or
   other persistent personal identifiers. Each response is stored with a UTC
   timestamp and a randomly generated completion code used solely for dataset
   integrity checks. No raw free-text responses that could contain personal
   identifiers are retained in the published dataset.

4. Data license and sharing. Non-sensitive derived data (e.g., Likert
   ratings, aggregated means, and plots) are published under **CC-BY-NC 4.0**
   to encourage academic reuse while restricting commercial redistribution.
   The repository clearly separates raw collection artifacts from published
   snapshots; raw logs that could contain unanticipated identifiers are not
   published.

5. Future clinical extensions and IRB. If this work is extended to clinical
   populations or settings involving sensitive personal data, we commit to
   obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Research Ethics Committee
   approval before data collection and to following any additional data
   protection and consent procedures required by the approving body.

6. Responsible use. This work aims to inform research in human-AI
   interaction and social cognition. It is not intended to provide guidance
   for manipulative or exploitative deployments. Users of the code and
   artifacts should follow the ethical norms of their institution and domain.

Pareto Frontier: Trade-off between task reward and Social Intelligence Quotient (SIQ).

This figure shows the empirical Pareto frontier computed from the Week 5
Bayesian sweep. Each point corresponds to a policy configuration (scalarized
by \u03bb social weight) and plots task utility on the x-axis vs SIQ on the
y-axis. Publication-quality figure: 1200x800 px, vector-friendly colors.

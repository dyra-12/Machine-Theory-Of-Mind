Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to misconduct.

## Scope

This Code applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
